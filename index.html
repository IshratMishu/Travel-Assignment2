        <img src="Images/roadtrip.png" alt="">
        <p class="popular-tour-guide">How can you make travel your lifestyle no matter your circumstances, bank balance or life stage?
            You're in the right place. We've done that for over 23 years now.
            I've turned up to 3 countries with very little money to my name - only oodles of determination, courage, and flexibility.
            I quickly learned that I am powerful and resourceful and when my back is against the wall, I can turn lemons into lemonade quickly.
            We made sure this lifestyle would not end once we had kids.
            For 13 years now we've made family travel a priority with the last 7 years full time with our two daughters.
            We KNOW how to make travel a reality.
            Travel is the most amazing wrapped present - the inside is the transformation of you.
    I travel because it makes my life so much better in many ways.
    And because it makes my life rich and full with wonderful memories of cherished moments around the world with cherished people in beautiful settings.
            We truly believe if we could do it, you can to!

        <img src="Images/family.png" alt="">
        <p class="popular-tour-guide">Do you want to travel more with your kids but are unsure how to balance it with school?
            Are you thinking of homeschooling your child?
            Or perhaps unschooling, worldschooling or roadschooling where you pretty much let travel and life take care of your child's learning?
            Imagine the freedom that comes with that - more time for authentic family connections and lifelong memories.
            Here's how and why I (Caz) can help you:
            15 years teaching in 5 different countries
            22 years of global travel (It has been my greatest tool for growth and empowerment i.e. the goals of education)
            7 years of homeschooling my own children (now 15 and 11)
            Balancing roadschooling with a full time travel lifestyle and online business. We know how to balance and make it work among the chaos.</p>

        <h5 class="popular-tour-guide-1">STAYING HEALTHY ON THE ROAD</h5>
        <img src="Images/ss.png" alt="">
        <p class="popular-tour-guide">Travel can be extremely taxing on your whole self: physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.
            The constant planning and movement from one place to another exhausts your energy and drains your brain.
            Plus the lack of consistency with habits, routines, and healthy eating can cause complete chaos for your body.
            Let's face it - we like to indulge when we travel, which is so much fun at the time, but filled with regret long after.
            Then there is so much more to think about in terms of diseases, illnesses, and injuries.
